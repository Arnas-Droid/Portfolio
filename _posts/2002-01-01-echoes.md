    <p><strong>Echoes of Imagination</strong></p>
    <p>Description: During the project I worked with a group of developers from Stoke-on-Trent and London to create Echoes of Imagination. For my role I worked as a gameplay programmer using Unreal’s blueprinting and made mechanics such as the movement, turn based system and other minor mechanics. Along this journey I hoped to learn C++ for Unreal, however due to medical reasons it was better at the time to work purely work through blueprints. Besides making mechanic and fixing any bugs, I worked closely with the leads to make sure that I contributed as much as possible.</p>
