    <p>Description: Using DirectX11, I learned more about graphic pipelines and how to create a 3D environment that utilized the pipeline for rendering lighting and shading models. Drawing inspiration from my heritage, I created the "witch forest" scene. My biggest challenge came when I was working on the scene graph hierarchy. I struggled with the idea of using functions to access different files. Although it worked when created in the main function, it felt a bit messy and harder to follow from an external viewpoint. Ultimately, I managed to build it, but there were issues I would approach differently in future projects. It's currently my favorite piece of work.</p>
