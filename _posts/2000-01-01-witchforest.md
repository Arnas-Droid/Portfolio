    <p>Description:
    Using DirectX11, I learned more about graphic pipelines and how to create a 3D environment that utilized the pipeline for rendering lighting and shading models. Drawing inspiration from my heritage, I created the "witch forest" scene. My biggest challenge came when I was working on the scene graph hierarchy. I struggled with the idea of using functions to access different files. Although it worked when created in the main function, it felt a bit messy and harder to follow from an external viewpoint. Ultimately, I managed to build it, but there were issues I would approach differently in future projects. It's currently my favorite piece of work.</p>

    <p>Using DirectX11 I learned more about graphic pipelines and how to create a 3D environment that used the pipeline for rendering lighting and shading models. Using this knowledge, I created the witch forest, which came to me as an idea through my heritage. My biggest struggle came when I was creating the scene graph hierarchy since I couldn’t wrap my head around when it came to using functions that would access different files. While I could make it work if it was created in main to me it felt like it wasn’t done correct and made aspects harder to follow if someone from the outside viewpoint would look at it. In the end I was able to create it, but it had problems that in future projects I would make sure to approach differently. Currently my favourite piece of work.</p>
