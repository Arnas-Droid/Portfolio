## University Projects
### Junior Collaborative Development

    <p><strong>Echoes of Imagination</strong></p>
    <p>During the project I worked with a group of developers from Stoke-on-Trent and London to create Echoes of Imagination. For my role I worked as a gameplay programmer using Unreal’s blueprinting and made mechanics such as the movement, turn based system and other minor mechanics. Along this journey I hoped to learn C++ for Unreal, however due to medical reasons it was better at the time to work purely work through blueprints. Besides making mechanic and fixing any bugs, I worked closely with the leads to make sure that I contributed as much as possible.</p>

### Introduction to Graphics Programming

  <div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 20px;">
    <p><strong>Simple Render Program</strong></p>
    <p>During this project I got introduced to graphics programming through OpenGL and didn’t really speak to me due to struggles with rendering from file. While it was working for the most part there was parts that were missing when rendering to screen. Other than that, though this project at a very basic level showed how to work with OpenGL and I created simple movement, camera system, and more inner workings.</p>

### Applied Mathmatics for Games

  <div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 20px;">
    <p><strong>Simple Physics Program</strong></p>
    <p>During this project I created a simple physics program that had point mass physics to simulate basic forces such as velocity and acceleration, where I personally expanded to have gravity and drag. Also implemented rigid body physics to simulate rotation of objects through Quaternions, Inertia Tensor and Moment of Inertia. In the end having similar logic to Issac Newton's laws and collisions. Didn’t have to go through too much struggle through this project since anything like equations and functions that already exist in real life could be research and converted into C++ code. With one major setback being at the end of the project where after iterating and simplifying code made it function worse than in previous states.</p>

### Bespoke Platform Devlopment

    <p><strong>Gravity Bind: Space Edition</strong></p>
    <p>During this project I created a game that was ported to the Evercade after following the proper procedure when creating a game. This included a research period, development period and porting period. It taught me how to investigate game design principles and project management, which without I wouldn’t have been able to create a fully fledge out game that was ported. Common struggles involved were porting to Evercade since it wasn’t as simple as pressing a couple of buttons and having worked on it so much throughout the period of the project, I devised my own method of step by step that always worked.</p>
