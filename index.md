### Direct11 Graphics 
This module looked at creating a structured 3D environment with a programmable pipeline for rendering lighting and shading models. The end result allowed me to have a beautifully rendered environment. It is currently my favourite piece of work that I have done so far.

### Physics Render
This module looked at grasping the mathematical basis of physical systems and building computer-based simulation. The end result allowed me to have forces that are akin to Isaac Newton's law and collisions.

### Bespoke
This module focused more on the design aspect of games since I had to look into game design principles and project management. The end result allowed me to export the program to the Evercade.
