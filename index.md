    <p><strong>Echoes of Imagination</strong></p>
    <p>During the project I worked with a group of developers from Stoke-on-Trent and London to create Echoes of Imagination. For my role I worked as a gameplay programmer using Unreal’s blueprinting and made mechanics such as the movement, turn based system and other minor mechanics. Along this journey I hoped to learn C++ for Unreal, however due to medical reasons it was better at the time to work purely work through blueprints. Besides making mechanic and fixing any bugs, I worked closely with the leads to make sure that I contributed as much as possible.</p>

    <p><strong>Witch Forest</strong></p>
    <p>During this project I learned more about graphic pipelines and how to create a 3D environment that used the pipeline for rendering lighting and shading models. Using this knowledge, I created the witch forest, which came to me as an idea through my heritage. My biggest struggle came when I was creating the scene graph hierarchy since I couldn’t wrap my head around when it came to using functions that would access different files. While I could make it work if it was created in main to me it felt like it wasn’t done correct and made aspects harder to follow if someone from the outside viewpoint would look at it. In the end I was able to create it, but it had problems that in future projects I would make sure to approach differently. Currently my favourite piece of work.</p>

### Introduction to Graphics Programming
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 20px;">
    <p><strong>Simple Render Program</strong></p>
    <p>During this project I got introduced to graphics programming through OpenGL and didn’t really speak to me due to struggles with rendering from file. While it was working for the most part there was parts that were missing when rendering to screen. Other than that, though this project at a very basic level showed how to work with OpenGL and I created simple movement, camera system, and more inner workings.</p>

### Applied Mathmatics for Games
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 20px;">
    <p><strong>Simple Physics Program</strong></p>
    <p>During this project I created a simple physics program that had point mass physics to simulate basic forces such as velocity and acceleration, where I personally expanded to have gravity and drag. Also implemented rigid body physics to simulate rotation of objects through Quaternions, Inertia Tensor and Moment of Inertia. In the end having similar logic to Issac Newton's laws and collisions. Didn’t have to go through too much struggle through this project since anything like equations and functions that already exist in real life could be research and converted into C++ code. With one major setback being at the end of the project where after iterating and simplifying code made it function worse than in previous states.</p>

### Bespoke Platform Devlopment

    <p><strong>Gravity Bind: Space Edition</strong></p>
    <p>This module focused more on the design aspect of games since I had to look into game design principles and project management. The end result allowed me to export the program to the Evercade.</p>
